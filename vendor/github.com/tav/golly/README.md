**Contribute**

We've made a tool called `git-review` to make it really easy for you  
to contribute. If you haven't used it before, just install it with  
the following command:

```bash
$ sudo easy_install git-review
```

Then, to contribute any patches, simply create a new branch for your  
work:

```bash
$ git checkout -b name-for-your-patch
```

And to submit it for review, make sure you've added yourself to the  
`AUTHORS` file and run:

```bash
$ git review submit
```

That's it! Thanks.
